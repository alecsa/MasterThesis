\abstract

The shortage of graphical editors for RDF vocabularies motivated the development of our work. In this thesis, we propose a web client for visualizing and editing ontologies represented as RDF graphs. Additionally, the graphical editor is synchronized with a text-based editor. As a result, the changes performed on one view are instantly propagated to the other view, without the need of user interaction in order to keep the two sides updated. Another feature of the editor is graph clustering, which facilitates browsing RDF graphs even when they become large in size.  Furthermore, the goal to provide a user-friendly application is validated in a user study. We also evaluated the time performance by conducting a series of tests.

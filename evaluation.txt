TASKS

- Load Country.ttl. Go to the graphical view and add a new language label for mv:Country (e.g. "Pays"@fr).
- Uncheck "Hide defaults" in order to see the nodes from the RDF, RDFS and OWL vocabularies.
- Click "Split view".
The following tasks shall be done using the graphical view.
- Define a new property entity by adding a node (e.g. "Prop1") and make it of type (rdf:type) rdf:Property. Note that the rdf:Property node already exists.
- Click on the new node to see it in text.
- Make mv:Country the property's domain (rdfs:domain) and rdfs:literal its range (rdfs:range).
- Add a description for the property.
- Modify the property's label (e.g. "Prop2").
The following task shall be done using the code view.
- Delete the property node.

QUESTIONS

- technical background of the participant?

1. Did the graph visualization represent the information in an understandable way?
2. Is the graphical editor intuitive to use?
3. Does the synchronization help with understanding the code representation in Turtle?
4. Do you have any suggestions?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- measure the total time (and the time taken on each task ?) ??

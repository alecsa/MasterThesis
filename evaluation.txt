TASKS

- Load Country.ttl. Go to the graphical view and add a new language label for mv:Country (e.g. "Pays"@fr).
- Uncheck "Hide defaults" in order to see the nodes from the rdf and rdfs vocabularies.
- Click "Split view".
- Define a new property by adding a node (e.g. Prop1) and make it of type (rdf:type) rdf:Property.
- Click on the new node to see it in text.
- Make mv:Country the property's domain (rdfs:domain) and rdfs:literal its range (rdfs:range).
- Modify the property's label (e.g. Prop2).
- Delete the property node but keep the nodes that are linked to it.

QUESTIONS

- technical background of the participant?

1. Did the graph visualization represent the information in an understandable way?
2. Is the graphical editor intuitive to use?
3. Does the synchronization help with understanding the code representation in Turtle?
4. Do you have any suggestions?

- measure the total time (and the time taken on each task ?) ??
